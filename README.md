# Pronunciation Correction Webside

The university offers a course related to childhood hearing impairment, and the group project is to create a website that plays words. The purpose is to help primary caregivers of hearing-impaired children easily utilize this website to enhance the children's listening and language abilities.
The project team consists of students from the Biomedical Engineering and Special Education departments. Together, we brainstormed the functionalities required for the website, and I am responsible for designing the frontend presentation of the webpage. This is my first self-taught project in web development.



Explanation of Website Functionalities：
On the homepage, the categories are classified based on different pronunciation areas. By clicking on the desired category, users can proceed to the next page for practice.
On the page for playing audio, on the left side, users can select images to choose the speech sounds they want to practice. There are two default speech sounds available for playback, and users can also upload their own audio files to play. Additionally, users can play background noise to increase the difficulty of listening. On the right side, users can record the practice results of hearing-impaired children and assess their learning effectiveness.
