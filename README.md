# Pronunciation Correction Webside

The university offers a course related to childhood hearing impairment, and the group project is to create a website that plays words. The purpose is to help primary caregivers of hearing-impaired children easily utilize this website to enhance the children's listening and language abilities.

The project team consists of students from the Biomedical Engineering and Special Education departments. Together, we brainstormed the functionalities required for the website, and I am responsible for designing the frontend presentation of the webpage. This is my first self-taught project in web development.
